# Ocotillo BDD Feature Repository

This repository contains **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** specifications for the _Ocotillo_ data management application.  
It defines user-facing and backend behaviors for field data entry, hydrograph visualization, and data correction workflows, ensuring traceable alignment between business requirements, QA automation, and implementation.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Define system behaviors in **business-readable Gherkin** syntax.  
- Provide a single source of truth for test coverage, validation logic, and workflow consistency.  
- Enable collaboration between **hydrogeologists, data managers, QA engineers, and developers**.  
- Support automated testing with tools like [Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/).
