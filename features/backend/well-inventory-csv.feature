Feature: Bulk upload well inventory from CSV
  As a hydrogeologist or data specialist
  I want to upload a CSV file containing well inventory data for multiple wells
  So that well records can be created efficiently and accurately in the system

  Background:
    Given a functioning api
    And valid lexicon values exist for:
      | lexicon category      |
      | contact_role          |
      | contact_type          |
      | phone_type            |
      | email_type            |
      | address_type          |
      | elevation_method      |
      | well_pump_type        |
      | well_purpose          |
      | well_hole_status      |
      | monitoring_frequency  |

  Scenario: Uploading a valid well inventory CSV containing required and optional fields
    Given a valid CSV file for bulk well inventory upload
    And my CSV file is encoded in UTF-8 and uses commas as separators
    And my CSV file contains multiple rows of well inventory data
    And the CSV includes required fields:
      | required field name     |
      | project                 |
      | well_name_point_id      |

      | elevation_ft            |
      | elevation_method        |
      | measuring_point_height_ft |
    And each "well_name_point_id" value is unique per row
    And "date_time" values are valid ISO 8601 timestamps with timezone offsets (e.g. "2025-02-15T10:30:00-08:00")
    And the CSV includes optional fields when available:
